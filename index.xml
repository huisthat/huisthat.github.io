      <description>I recently helped my sister design her album cover art for her song I went travelling on a Mobius Strip and I really liked the drawing I did:D
Her song is on Spotify as well as Youtube! I really like the song and it is stuck in my head.</description>

      <description>This was the final paper I wrote for another USP module called Democracy and Inequality (USE2325)
It was an extremely eye opening module and I think I have learnt alot, especially about the different causes and types of inequalities. I have tried to apply my newfound knowledge and my own experiences in this paper.

      <description>Introduction This was an individual project that is making a bot that keep tracks of the todos, deadlines and events. For deadlines and events, there will be a date and time tagged to it. It is implemented using Java, and the GUI is made using JavaFx. The jar file can be found here!
How it looks like:
Challenges One of the biggest challenges was implementing the GUI using JavaFx. I was initially really confused by the stage, scene etc, but after a few days of mulling over it, I can finally figure out how things work and get them to work as I wanted them to.</description>

README
Introduction This was a pair project done over the course of three months, It was rewarding and fulfilling, as I learnt to start and complete a software development project from scratch.
Project Introduction ModPal is a graphical visualization tool for module planning. Our dynamic maps model the connections among modules in NUS, so university students can get a big picture of their academic roadmap, and visualize and explore what its curriculum coverage really means.</description>

      <description>This was the final paper I wrote for a USP module called Human Trafficking and Labour Migration (UWC2101F)
It may not be the best, but I was quite proud of it as it was my first time writing an actual long paper, which I would not have done if not for USP.
Construction Workers in Singapore: Their Precarious Situation and Ways to Mitigate It
Abstract
This paper examines the predicament of construction workers in Singapore, and uses Ruhs and Martin’s paper on the tradeoffs between numbers and rights of workers to explain the minimal rights the workers receive.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my blog:D I&amp;rsquo;m Linglong, currently a computer science student at National University of Singapore, also in the University Scholars Programme.
I&amp;rsquo;ve separated my blog into two sections, one for more serious and official posts here and one for more creative things such as my hobbies over here, located in the CREATIVE tab at the top. I am still currently trying to shift some of my CREATIVE posts over from my previous blog, hence there isn&amp;rsquo;t much stuff there.</description>
