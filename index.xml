      <description>I recently helped my sister design her album cover art for her song I went travelling on a Mobius Strip and I really liked the drawing I did:D
Her song is on Spotify as well as Youtube! I really like the song and it is stuck in my head.</description>

      <description>This was the final paper I wrote for a USP module called Human Trafficking and Labour Migration (UWC2101F)
It may not be the best, but I was quite proud of it as it was my first time writing an actual long paper, which I would not have done if not for USP.
Construction Workers in Singapore: Their Precarious Situation and Ways to Mitigate It
Abstract
This paper examines the predicament of construction workers in Singapore, and uses Ruhs and Martinâ€™s paper on the tradeoffs between numbers and rights of workers to explain the minimal rights the workers receive.</description>
